# Double-Machine-Learning-Application
This DML App is a Shiny application designed to facilitate data processing, correlation analysis, Double Lasso Selection, and Double Machine Learning (DML) for causal inference. 

Features
Data Upload: Users can upload data files in .csv or .dta formats.
Data Processing: Users can preprocess the data by selecting outcome and treatment variables, as well as additional features.
Correlation Analysis: The app performs correlation analysis on the processed data and displays the results in a heatmap and text format.
Double Lasso Selection: Users can run Double Lasso Selection to identify important features for the model.
Double Machine Learning: The app supports running Double Machine Learning using various model types (Elastic Net, Regression Trees, Random Forest, Boosted Trees) to estimate causal effects.
Results Display: The app displays the results of the DML analysis, including coefficient estimates, confidence intervals, and p-values.
